\section{Introduction}
Videos are a ubiquitous, in the UK it has been claimed that there is one observation camera per 14 citizens [CLAIM: "A CCTV camera for every 14 citizens."
David Davis, resignation statement, 12 June 2008 ]. YouTube.com the largest video website in the USA with a marketshare of 99\% of all watched online videos serves more than 10 Billion movies a month[http://mashable.com/2009/09/28/august-comscore-data/]. 
Furthermore, the amount of videos uploded to the site through mobile phones is growing exponentially[http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/06/mobile-uploads-to-youtube-up-400-after-iphone-3gs-launch.ars].
Ideally we would like to analyse video's to be able to extract their content, forinstance, to make them accessible for search or to alert the viewer of important developments. One of these analysis is tracking an object through multipe frames of video.

Generally tracking can be done in two distinct manners; First, a model of the object to be tracked can be build, one can think of a wireframe model of the object together with texture or color information. 
In every frame this model is searched for and the location that resembles the model best is the location of the object. A problem with this approach is that a model for every object needs to be build, usually can only be applied to small specialist domains. 
The other approach does not build a full model but looks at the appearance of an object and looks searches for regions that appear the same, thus not a fully descriptive model is build. 
The assumption is that small local features of the tracked model appear the same over multiple frames, one such feature is color.

This paper will present and compare methods within the appearance based vision paradigm, namely the color based mean-shift tracker and brute-force tracker. 
Since color will be the feature that will be tracked, different color models will be presented, applied and subsequent tracking results on diffent videos for both trackers will be discussed.
The main focus of this paper will be to present and compare the mean-shift tracker and explain through experiments how the tracker behaves under varying video conditions. (such as occulusion and objects of varying scales), and what the influence of the used color model is.
As said at the beginning ofthis section videos are pervasive, and their analysis should therefore ideally be done in realtime. The speed of the tracker will therefore also be discussed.

This paper is organised as follows, after an introduction of the topic in section 1, the theory behind the used trackers and colorspaces will be discussed in section 2.
Section 3 will be devoted to the implementation of the presented theories. The experimental setup, subsequent results and their discussion will be presented in section 4. 
Finally, section 5 will present the main conclusions on color based mean shift tracking.

\section{Future Work} \label{sec:fut}
Observe how you can improve your design and them describe how you implemented this change or, for lack of time, describe how you would change your design. 

e.g. a different color space or the number of bins in the histogram
test the tracker also on a video of a domain other than soccer (or any other sport on a green field)
